<div>{{MDNSidebar}}</div><p>Only MDN administrators are able to delete pages. <span class="seoSummary">This article explains how to request that a page be removed from MDN.</span></p>

<p>To arrange for a page to be deleted, you should do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li><strong>Do not erase or change the page content.</strong> We want to have the record of the page as it was at deletion time.</li>
 <li>Add the tag "junk" to the page. Do not remove other tags.</li>
 <li>If the page is particularly urgently in need of deletion (for example, its content is inappropriate, offensive, or technically dangerous), <a href="mailto:mdn-admins@mozilla.org" title="Notify an administrator">notify an MDN administrator</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>An administrator will delete the page when possible, after confirming that deletion is appropriate</p>
