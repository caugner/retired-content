<p>Whereas {{glossary("HTML")}} only specifies content structure, another major Web technology called {{Glossary('CSS')}} specifies how the content should look.</p>

<p>CSS stands for <em>Cascading style sheet</em>. You can write CSS code inside {{HTMLElement("style")}} tags, but you normally write separate <code>.css</code> files so you can reuse styling information. CSS uses selectors to apply styles to HTML elements. We suggest you start with the following pages to pick up some skills and learn how to use CSS properly. Pick a page that looks interesting to you. If you don't know where to start, move from the first basic skill to the last advanced skill.</p>
