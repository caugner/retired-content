<div>{{MDNSidebar}}</div><p><span class="seoSummary">You can define the summary of a page on MDN, to be used in various ways, including in search engine results, in other MDN pages such as topical landing pages, and in tooltips.</span> It should be text that makes sense both in the context of the page, and when displayed in other contexts, without the rest of the page content.</p>
<p>A summary can be explicitly defined within a page. If it is not explicitly defined, then typically the first sentence or so is used, which is not always the best text for this purpose.</p>
<table class="full-width-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>What is the task?</strong></td>
   <td>Marking the text within a page that should be used as its summary in other contexts; this task might include writing appropriate text if needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Where does it need to be done?</strong></td>
   <td>In pages that lack a summary or have a less-than-great summary.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>What do you need to know to do the task?</strong></td>
   <td>Ability to use the MDN editor; good English writing skills; enough familiarity with the topic of the page to write a good summary.</td>

   <td>
    <ol>
     <li>Pick a page on which to set the summary:
      <ol>
       <li>In the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status">MDN documentation status</a> page, click the link under <strong>Sections</strong> for a topic that you know something about (for example, HTML).</li>
       <li>On the topic's documentation status page, click the <strong>Pages</strong> header in the <strong>Summary</strong> table. This takes you to an index of all the pages in that topic section; it shows the page links in the left column, and the tags and summaries in the right column.</li>
       <li>Pick a page that is missing a summary, or that has a poor summary.</li>
       <li>Click the link to go to that page.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to open the page in the MDN editor.</li>
     <li>Look for a sentence or two that works as a summary out of context. If needed, edit the existing content to create or modify sentences to be a good summary.</li>
     <li>Select the text to be used as a summary.</li>
     <li>In the <em>Styles</em> widget of the editor toolbar, select <strong>SEO Summary</strong>. (In the page source, this creates a {{HTMLElement("span")}} element with <code>class="seoSummary"</code> around the selected text.)</li>
     <li>Save your changes with a revision comment like "Set the page summary."</li>
    </ol>
