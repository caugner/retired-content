<p>A good time, a good atmosphere, and what could be better than being well undermined. For the occasion, we want to be on our 31. So the fateful question of what to wear begins to trot in the head. As soon as you decide on a gray evening dress, there are still several questions. What model, what cut, what material, what accessories and adornments, and above all that color of the dress to wear. What if we decided on a gray dress? Bland, who told you such nonsense! Did you not know that the trend is gray? Highlighted properly, it eclipses all other colors. </p>

<p>A mixture of black and white, it is an interesting alternative for lovers of black &amp; white. Know that with your gray dress, you will be of the sexiest refinement. Gray is suitable for all women regardless of their skin color. It is a neutral color to which we give the desired shine. There are several shades of it from the lightest to the darkest. So you have the possibility to choose your evening dress for weddings ranging from pearl gray to metallic gray. The materials in which it is found are numerous, each bringing its own touch to color. If you choose a maxi dress in silky satin or silk, the shine effect is more than guaranteed, especially since the gray hangs well in the light. Rather a dress in chiffon, lace, here implies a play of transparency of majestic softness.</p>

<p>The gray wedding dress is not just wintery, as we often think. Although so much whiteness contrasts very well with it, it goes well in all seasons, well in both hot and cool weather. To go to a party during the spring-summer, you could opt for a short gray dress in silk or satin strapless or with straps. Sheath or ballerina according to the desire of each one. A great choice for a slim person. If you want to go lengthwise, a clean fabric such as lace, tulle, or muslin, for an empire, mermaid, or duchess cut. Fall-winter, we will focus on volume, why not a gray velvet dress, mermaid cut, or a satin dress with a sumptuous drape with long sleeves and a play of transparency.</p>

<p>In terms of accessories, you should know that gray is very suitable for other colors but should not be overshadowed. If your dress is not already adorned with rhinestones, beading, sequins, and more, then adornments that add sparkle would be welcome. Clutch and shoe will probably match, black, white, or why not a total gray look.</p>

<p>Gray evening dresses the short strapless A-line heart-shaped evening dress adorned with strapless rhinestones or the pleated &amp; appliquéd evening dress with illusion collar; yes muslin, vaporous materials are in vogue. Greek goddess or princess, that's what these two models inspire. Both in the same style, yet the first a dark ash gray and the second a very light gray. The difference is also at the level of the asymmetrically decorated bustier for the second and stepped for the first. On the online store of robespourmariage.fr, you can customize them.</p>
