<p>The following can be useful when developing games based on Web technologies.</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas">Canvas</a>: 2D graphics.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/WebGL">WebGL</a>: 3D graphics.</li>
 <li>Audio: {{htmlelement("audio")}} element, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API.</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/WebSockets">WebSockets</a>: Can be used for real-time communication between a player and the game server, to support multi-player games.</li>
 <li><a class="external" href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>: Node is often used as a multiplayer game server, controlling the logic and handling the WebSockets connections to the players. It can be used for player authentication and the storage of data so gameplay can persist over multiple game sessions. This is all made relatively easy with great third-party modules, like Socket.IO for WebSockets, and others that handle Redis and MongoDB for storage.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Storage">DOM Storage</a>: Great for storing data locally on the player's device. This way you can cache game data and allow the game to continue where the player left off.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Using_full_screen_mode">Full Screen API</a> : Allows you to expand any HTML element to ﬁll the user's screen, even if the browser isn’t running full-screen itself.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker_API">ServiceWorker API</a>: Traditionally one of the main differences between Web apps and native apps was that unlike web apps, native apps could be run offline. This has changed — technologies such as Service Workers allow for a website or web app to cache necessary assets so it can still run while offline. This includes things like JavaScript ﬁles, CSS and images. Combining this technique with intelligent use of things like localStorage will allow your game to continue working even if the Internet connection goes down. You just need to sync up all the changes when it gets connected again.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/API/Gamepad/Using_Gamepad_API">Gamepad API</a>: Allows you to control web–based games via a gamepad. This might be just what ﬁnally justifies HTML5 gaming on a TV or console. Who wants to use a keyboard and mouse while sitting on the sofa?</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Pointer_Lock">Pointer Lock API</a>: An attempt to improve the mouse as an input device, in situations such as games and 3D visualizations where the mouse position rotates or moves you around a 3D space. As it stands, there would still be a cursor moving around the screen causing all sorts of trouble when you want to click on something in your game. With this API, you can lock your mouse position, or even hide it altogether, using the mouse movement to move the game world instead.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not every browser supports every part of HTML5. For example, Canvas isn’t supported out of the box by any Internet Explorer version below 9. However, you can use Explorer Canvas to replicate canvas functionality (but that is not ideal and does not perform as well). WebSockets is supported by IE only in IE 10, and it isn’t supported in the stock browser of Android. But again, you can fake this by using Flash for the sockets, such as with Socket.IO. While supported in the latest versions of every other browser, WebGL in Internet Explorer requires at least version 11.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-game-stub">Mortar Game Stub</a> template to get a quick start on an HTML5 game, or you can use it to get ideas on best practices.</p>
