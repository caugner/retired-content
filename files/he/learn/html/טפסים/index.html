<p class="summary">This module provides a series of articles that will help you master HTML forms. HTML forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users; however, for historical and technical reasons, it's not always obvious how to use them to their full potential. In this guide, we'll cover all aspects of HTML forms, from structure to styling, from data handling to custom widgets.</p>

<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before starting this module, you should at least work through our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a>. At this point you should find the {{anch("Basic guides")}} easy to understand, and also be able to make use of our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets">Native form widgets</a> guide.</p>

<p>The rest of the module however is a bit more advanced — it is easy to put form widgets on a page, but you can't actually do much with them without using some advanced form features, CSS, and JavaScript. Therefore, before you look at the other sections we'd recommend that you go away and learn some <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">CSS</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> first.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as <a href="http://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a> or <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/">Thimble</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Basic_guides">Basic guides</h2>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form">Your first HTML form</a></dt>
 <dd>The first article in our series provides your very first experience of creating an HTML form, including designing a simple form, implementing it using the right HTML elements, adding some very simple styling via CSS, and how data is sent to a server.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/How_to_structure_an_HTML_form">How to structure an HTML form</a></dt>
 <dd>With the basics out of the way, we now look in more detail at the elements used to provide structure and meaning to the different parts of a form.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="What_form_widgets_are_available">What form widgets are available?</h2>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets">The native form widgets</a></dt>
 <dd>We now look at the functionality of the different form widgets in detail, looking at what options are available to collect different types of data.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Validating_and_submitting_form_data">Validating and submitting form data</h2>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data">Sending form data</a></dt>
 <dd>This article looks at what happens when a user submits a form — where does the data go, and how do we handle it when it gets there? We also look at some of the security concerns associated with sending form data.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation">Form data validation</a></dt>
 <dd>Sending data is not enough — we also need to make sure that the data users fill out in forms is in the correct format we need to process it successfully, and that it won't break our applications. We also want to help our users to fill out our forms correctly and don't get frustrated when trying to use our apps. Form validation helps us achieve these goals — this article tells you what you need to know.</dd>

<h2 id="Advanced_guides">Advanced guides</h2>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/How_to_build_custom_form_widgets">How to build custom form widgets</a></dt>
 <dd>You'll come across some cases where the native form widgets just don't provide what you need, e.g. because of styling or functionality. In such cases, you may need to build your own form widget out of raw HTML. This article explains how you'd do this and the considerations you need to be aware of when doing so, with a practical case study.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Sending_forms_through_JavaScript">Sending forms through JavaScript</a></dt>
 <dd>This article looks at ways to use a form to assemble an HTTP request and send it via custom JavaScript, rather than standard form submission. It also looks at why you'd want to do this, and the implications of doing so. (See also Using FormData objects.)</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/HTML_forms_in_legacy_browsers">HTML forms in legacy browsers</a></dt>
 <dd>Article covering feature detection, etc. This should be redirected to the cross browser testing module, as the same stuff is covered better there.</dd>
