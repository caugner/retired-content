<p class="summary">We all learn to write a letter sooner or later; it is also a useful example to test out our text formatting skills! In this assessment you'll be given a letter to mark up to test basic and advanced HTML text formatting skills, including hyperlinks, plus we'll test your familiarity with some HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> contents.</p>

<h2 id="Starting_point">Starting point</h2>

<p>To get this assessment started, you should go and grab the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/marking-up-a-letter-start/letter-text.txt">raw text you need to mark up</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/marking-up-a-letter-start/css.txt">CSS you need to include</a> in your HTML. Create a new <code>.html</code> file using your text editor to do your work in (or alternatively use a site like <a class="external external-icon" href="http://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a> or <a class="external external-icon" href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/">Thimble</a> to do your assessment.)</p>

<h2 id="Project_brief">Project brief</h2>

<p>For this project, your task is to mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to the university.</p>

<p>Block/structural semantics:</p>

<ul>
 <li>You should structure the overall document with an appropriate structure including doctype, and {{htmlelement("html")}}, {{htmlelement("head")}} and {{htmlelement("body")}} elements.</li>
 <li>The letter in general should be marked up with a structure of paragraphs and headings, with the exception of the below points. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) and three second level headings.</li>
 <li>The semester start dates, study subjects and exotic dances should be marked up using an appropriate list type.</li>
 <li>The two addresses can just be put inside paragraphs. The {{htmlelement("address")}} element is not appropriate for them — think about why. In addition, each line of the addresses should sit on a new line, but not be in a new paragraph.</li>
</ul>

<p>Inline semantics:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The names of the sender and receiver (and "Tel" and "Email") should be marked up with strong importance.</li>
 <li>The four dates in the document should be given appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.</li>
 <li>The first address and first date in the letter should be given a class attribute value of "sender-column"; the CSS you'll add later will then cause these to be right aligned, as should be the case in a classic letter layout.</li>
 <li>The five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text of the letter should be marked up to provide expansions of each acronym/abbreviation.</li>
 <li>The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately — in the chemical formulae,  and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power or 3 and 4, respectively).</li>
 <li>Try to mark up at least two appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.</li>
 <li>There are two places where a hyperlink should be added; add appropriate links with titles. For the location that the links point to, just use http://example.com.</li>
 <li>The university motto quote and citation should be marked up with appropriate elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The head of the document:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The character set of the document should be specified as utf-8 using an appropriate meta tag.</li>
 <li>The author of the letter should be specified in an appropriate meta tag.</li>
 <li>The provided CSS should be included inside an appropriate tag.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Hints_and_tips">Hints and tips</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Use the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> to validate your HTML; you'll get bonus points if it validates.</li>
 <li>You don't need to know any CSS to do this assessment; you just need to put the provided CSS inside an HTML element.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows an example of what the letter might look like after being marked up.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>If you are following this assessment as part of an organized course, you should be able to give your work to your teacher/mentor for marking. If you are self-learning, then you can get the marking guide fairly easily by asking on the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/marking-up-a-letter-assignment/24676">discussion thread about this exercise</a>, or in the <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn">#mdn</a> IRC channel on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">Mozilla IRC</a>. Try the exercise first — there is nothing to be gained by cheating!</p>
