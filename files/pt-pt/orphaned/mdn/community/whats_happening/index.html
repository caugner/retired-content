<p>The MDN documentation team maintains a <a href="https://trello.com/b/HAhl54zz/status">Trello board</a> on which our projects are tracked. This board is read-only but will let you see what's being worked on and what we hope to do soon, and may help you figure out where you can help. <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Community/Trello">This article</a> explains how this board is used.</p>

<p>In addtion, take a look at the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status">Documentation status</a> pages to see what's going on across the full breadth of MDN content. You'll be able to see what articles need to be written or updated, what topics need the most help, and much, much more.</p>

<h2 id="Encontros_da_MDN">Encontros da MDN</h2>

<p>There are a number of regular meetings for tracking and sharing progress on various MDN-related projects and processes. These are described on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings">MDN meetings wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>To get a general sense of what's happening, the best meeting to attend is the MDN Community meeting, which occurs every two weeks on Wednesdays, 10:00 US Pacific time (UTC-0800 October-March, UTC-0700 in March-October), in the <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/devmo">#mdn</a> <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC" title="http://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">IRC</a> channel. See the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings/Community" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Community_meetings">MDN community meetings</a> wiki page for agendas and notes from past meetings.</p>
