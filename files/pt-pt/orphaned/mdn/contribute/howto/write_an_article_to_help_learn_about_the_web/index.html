<p>A <strong><a href="/pt-PT/docs/Learn">Área de Aprendizagem</a></strong> da MDN é o nosso local para os artigos que introduzem os conceitos da Web para os novos programadores. Porque o seu conteúdo, principalmente, tem como alvo os principiantes, é um local excelente para partilhar os seus conhecimentos e ajudar estes a conhecer a Web. É importante certificar-se que os novos programadores podem seguir este conteúdo, por isso nós damos especial atenção a este.</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">Este artigo explica sobre como escrever as páginas para a <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Learn">Área de Aprendizagem</a>.</span></p>

<h2 id="Como_escrever_um_artigo_da_Área_de_Aprendizagem">Como escrever um artigo da <u><strong>Área de Aprendizagem</strong></u></h2>

<p>To start contributing your knowledge, simply click the big green button, then follow the five steps below. If you're looking for ideas, please take a look at the <a href="https://trello.com/b/LDggrYSV">our team Trello board</a>!</p>

<p></p><div class="align-center"><a class="button ignore-external mega positive" href="/pt-PT/docs/new?parent=111819">Escrever um novo artigo de aprendizagem<div></div></a></div><p></p>

<p>This article might not end up in exactly the right place, but at least it's on MDN. If you need to talk to someone about getting it moved to the right place, please  <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn#Contact_us">Contact us</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Passo_1_Write_a_two-liner">Passo 1: Write a two-liner</h3>

<p>Your article's first sentence needs to summarize what subject you're going to cover, and the second one should go into a few more specifics of the items that you'd put in the article. For example:</p>

<div class="summary">
<p>Whereas {{glossary("HTML")}} files contain structured content, {{Glossary("CSS")}}, another major Web technology, makes the content look the way you want. In this article we are going to cover how this technology works, and how to write your own basic example.</p>
</div>

<p>Note how the example briefly explains that CSS is a core Web technology used to style pages. That's enough for the reader to get a pretty good idea what the article covers.</p>

<p>Because Learning Area articles primarily target beginners, each article should cover one straightforward topic so as not to overwhelm the reader with too much new information. If you can't summarize the article in one sentence, you might be trying to do too much in one article!</p>

<h3 id="Passo_2_Add_a_top_box">Passo 2: Add a top box</h3>

<p>Then add a<strong> top box</strong> to help readers get their bearings as to where they are in the learning process.  Here's an example of a top box from <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Understanding_URLs">"Understanding URLs and their structure"</a>. You can use this article as an model when writing your own.</p>

<table class="learn-box standard-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th scope="row">Pré-requisitos:</th>
   <td>You need to first know <a class="new" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/How_the_Internet_works">how the Internet works</a>, <a class="new" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/What_is_a_Web_server">what a Web server is</a>, and <a class="new" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Understanding_links_on_the_web">the concepts behind links on the web</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th scope="row">Objetivo:</th>
   <td>You will learn what a URL is and how it works on the Web.</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<dl>
 <dt>Pré-requisitos</dt>
 <dd>What must the reader already know to follow the article? When possible, make each prerequisite a link to another Learning Area article covering the concept (unless it's a really basic article that doesn't require prior knowledge).</dd>
 <dt>Objetivos</dt>
 <dd>This section briefly states what the reader will learn over the course of the article. This is a bit different than the one-liner; the one-liner summarizes the topic of the article, while the objectives section specifically lays out what the reader can expect to accomplish over the course of the article.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Nota:</strong> To create this table, you can either copy and paste the example table above, or use MDN's editor's <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor/Tables">table tool</a>. If you choose to use the table tool, you need to specifically add the <code>learn-box</code> CSS class in addition to the default <code>standard-table</code> class. To do this, when you create or edit the table's properties,, go to the "Advanced" panel and set the <strong>Stylesheet Classes</strong> field to "<code>standard-table learn-box</code>".</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Passo_3_Write_a_full_description">Passo 3: Write a full description</h3>

<p>Next, write a longer description that provides a more thorough overview of the article highlighting the most important concepts. Don't forget to explain why the reader should take the time to learn this topic and read your article!</p>

<h3 id="Passo_4_Dig_deeper">Passo 4: Dig deeper</h3>

<p>When you're done with all that, you can finally dive deeply into the topic. You can structure this part of your article however you like (although feel free to consult our <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Style_guide">style guide</a>). This is your chance to shine! Go into detail explaining the topic you're writing about. Provide links to the full reference documentation, explain how the technology works in detail, provide syntax and usage details, and so forth. It's up to you!</p>

<p>As a guide, here are some writing tips for beginners:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Focus on a single topic. If you feel like you need to cover other topics, it means either you're missing a prerequisite article, or you need to break up your article into more than one.</li>
 <li>Use simple English. Avoid technical terms when you can, or at least define them and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Write_a_new_entry_in_the_Glossary#How_to_use_the_.7B.7BGlossary.7D.7D_macro">link to their glossary entries</a> where applicable.</li>
 <li>Include straightforward examples to make the theoretical concepts easier to grasp. Many people learn best by example. Rather than writing academic papers, we want beginners to follow the text readily.</li>
 <li>Visual aids often can make things easier to digest and carry extra information, so feel free to use images, diagrams, videos, and tables. If you're using diagrams or charts that include text, we encourage you to use {{Glossary("SVG")}} so our translation teams can localize the text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at the first few sections of our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions">Functions — reusable blocks of code</a> article for some good descriptive sections.</p>

<h3 id="Passo_5_Provide_active_learning_material">Passo 5: Provide "active learning" material</h3>

<p>To illustrate the article and help the reader better understand what they're learning, be sure to provide exercises, tutorials, and tasks to accomplish. By having them actively and practically using and experimenting with the concepts your article explains, you can help "lock" the information into their brains.</p>

<p>You can choose to include the examples directly in the page as <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Live_samples">live samples</a>, or <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor/Links">link to them</a> if they don't really work as a live sample. If you're interested in helping create these valuable materials, please read the article <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_an_interactive_exercise_to_help_learning_the_web">Create an interactive exercise to help learning the Web</a>.</p>

<p>If you can't provide links to existing active learning materials (you don't know of any or don't have time to create them), you should add the tag {{Tag("NeedsActiveLearning")}} to the article. That way other contributors can find articles that need active learning materials and perhaps help you come up with them.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Simple_selectors#Active_learning_Selecting_different_elements">Active learning: selecting different elements</a> for a live interactive learning exercise, or <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions#Active_learning_Playing_with_scope">Active learning: Playing with scope</a> for a different style of exercise that calls upon them to download a template locally and modify it following the provided steps.</p>

<h3 id="Passo_6_Get_the_article_reviewed_and_put_into_the_Learning_Area_navigation_menu">Passo 6: Get the article reviewed, and put into the Learning Area navigation menu</h3>

<p>After you've written your article, let us know so we can have a look at it, do a review, and suggest improvements. Again, see our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn#Contact_us">Contact us</a> section for the best ways to get in touch.</p>

<p>Another part finalizing your article is to put it in the Learning Area main navigation menu. This menu is generated by the <a href="/en-US/docs/Template:LearnSidebar">LearnSidebar macro</a>, which you need special privileges to edit, so again, talk ot one of our team about getting it added.</p>

<p>You should at least add it to your page — this is done by adding the macro call \{{LearnSidebar}} into a paragraph at the top of your page.</p>
